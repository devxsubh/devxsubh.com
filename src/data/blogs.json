      "content": "# Was It All Worth It?\n\n*By Subham Mahapatra*\n\nHalfway through my college journey, as I step into my third year at **Newton School of Technology**, I often find myself pausing and reflecting on how quickly these two years have gone by. When I look back at the whirlwind of experiences — the highs, the struggles, and everything in between — one question keeps coming to mind:\n\n**Was it all worth it?**\n\nWhen I entered college, I was full of hope and curiosity — not entirely sure where this journey would take me. One of my earliest milestones came when our team competed in the **IEEE**, ranking among the **top in Haryana** and the **top 19% worldwide**. That small win lit a spark of confidence and curiosity to push further.\n\nSoon, I found myself diving deep into **competitive programming**, spending countless nights debugging, learning, and solving problems. That dedication led me to the **ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)**, where I secured a strong rank. Around the same time, I began exploring **hackathons**, where I discovered the thrill of building something from scratch in just 24–48 hours. Those sleepless weekends taught me speed, collaboration, and the art of turning raw ideas into reality.\n\nIn my very first summer, I got the chance to pursue a **research internship at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur**. It gave me early exposure to structured problem-solving, academic research, and the patience needed to explore ideas in depth.\n\nBeyond academics, I discovered the joy of **leadership and community building**. I took on responsibilities across multiple clubs — leading the **E-Cell** and **Music Club**, and organizing our **first-ever college fest**. I also became a **core committee member at Neutron**, the first student-led organization of our college, where I led marketing and design. Together, we built campaigns, crafted branding strategies, and laid the foundation for something lasting.\n\nOne of the most unforgettable chapters came with an **international trip to Singapore**, where I had the chance to interact and collaborate with **CXOs and industry leaders**. Those conversations opened my eyes to the global perspective on innovation, leadership, and the power of vision-driven work.\n\nMy **entrepreneurial journey** has been equally defining. I built my first startup (which failed), joined another as an early founding member and helped it grow, and experimented with several ventures. Most of them didn't succeed — but each taught me something invaluable about **resilience, design, execution, and adaptability**.\n\nSo… was it all worth it?\n\nEvery late-night coding session.\n\nEvery failed pitch.\n\nEvery hackathon sprint.\n\nEvery fest organized.\n\nEvery conversation that expanded my thinking.\n\nEach of these moments — big or small — has shaped me into who I am today.\n\nThe wins gave me confidence. The failures gave me wisdom. And together, they gave me perspective.\n\nLooking back now, halfway through my college journey, I can confidently say —\n\n**Yes, it was absolutely worth it.**\n\n— *Subham Mahapatra*\n\n---\n\n### 📘 About the Author\n\n**Subham Mahapatra** is a product and tech enthusiast pursuing his B.Tech at **Newton School of Technology**.
